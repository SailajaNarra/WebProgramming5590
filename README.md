Creating new repository for Web Programming course
This is a Readme file for ICP-1 of the Web/Mobile Programming.
Vijaya Kumari Yeruva is the instructor of this course.
In ICP-1, we have created a Github account and created a new repository.
I have installed WebStorm in my desktop and created a sample HTML file.
